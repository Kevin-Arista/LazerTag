## Overview

This is a full-stack reservations application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. Users can fill out a reservation form with custom JavaScript-based form validation, and upon successful submission, they receive a unique reservation code generated using `uniqid`. This reservations website was made for the Art of Engineering Exposition at Columbia University by the team Manhattan Project 2.0.
